<pre>
Pinyin keyboard:

- b p m f d t n l z c s zh ch sh r j q x g k h 22
a o e i u ü 6
- a ai an ang ao e en eng i n ng o ong u r 16 (either redundant list of finals)
n ng r 3 (or just finals that aren’t also middle)
1 2 3 4 5 - (- would mean don’t know, don’t care about tone)

note “i” column in table below should be split to account for the two sounds: bi vs. zhi 
or just omit 2nd sound, as it’s redundant: z, c, s, zh, ch, sh, r don’t need the final i
all pinyin syllables are terminated with a tone, which removes ambiguities like xian, zhan, liao

The purpose of this keyboard would be to write pinyin in the minimum amount of taps

Would be interesting to do same / matching with zhuyin

based on a breakdown of this pinyin table
